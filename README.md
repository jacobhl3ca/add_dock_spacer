# Mac Dock Spacer

This script adds invisible spacers to your macOS Dock, allowing you to organize your apps into logical groups.

## What it does

- Creates invisible app tiles in your Dock that act as spacers
- Lets you visually organize your Dock into groups of related apps
- Works on all modern versions of macOS

## extremely complicated instructions:

1. Download "add_dock_spacer.sh"
2. Make the script executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x add_dock_spacer.sh
   ```
3. Run this in the command line app of your choice:
   ```bash
   ./add_dock_spacer.sh
   ```
4. Observe in amazement as a spacer appears in your Dock

## Usage Tips

- Run the script multiple times to add multiple spacers
- Drag spacers to position them between your apps
- Remove a spacer by dragging it out of the Dock (like any other app)

## Optional: Create an Alias (for even easier use)

Add this line to your `.zshrc` or `.bashrc` file:

```bash
alias addspace="/path/to/add_dock_spacer.sh"
```

Then you can simply type `addspace` in Terminal to add spacers anytime.
